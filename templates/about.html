              <h3>Establishment</h3>
              <p>As per the policy of the Government, one Jawahar Navodaya Vidyalaya is to be established in each district. Accordingly, 62 new JNVs have been sanctioned during 2016-17 in various districts of the country. In addition to this,10 JNVs each have been sanctioned in districts having a large concentration of SC & ST population. Besides this, 3 JNVs have been sanctioned in 03 districts i.e. Senapati-II (Manipur), Ukhrul-II (Manipur) & Ratlam-II (Madhya Pradesh) as special case, bringing the total number of JNVs sanctioned to 661. Each Vidyalaya has provision for a full-fledged campus with sufficient building for classrooms, dormitories, staff-quarters, dining-hall and other infrastructural facilities viz. play-grounds, workshops, library and labs etc. The opening of new Navodaya Vidyalayas is based on the offer from the State Government to provide around 30 acres of suitable land (relaxable on case to case basis) free of cost, alongwith sufficient temporary accommodation to run the school till the completion of permanent Vidyalaya building.</p>
